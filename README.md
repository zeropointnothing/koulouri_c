# koulouri - C++ Rewrite
a lightweight music player built for the user, now rewritten in C++.

---

You read that right. [Koulouri(py)](https://github.com/zeropointnothing/koulouri) is back and better than ever!

## DISCLAIMER
This project is currently in a heavy WIP state. Both frontends are nowhere near completion,
but progress is going steadily!

## What's new?

- With the power of PortAudio and libsndfile (through libKoulouri), Koulouri is faster, more memory efficient, and
filled with new improvements and features!
- The Qt GUI (work in progress) is making a comeback! With the tighter integration provided with the rewrite,
you can now choose how you want to interface with your music!
- The power of retrospect - libKoulouri was built upon the knowledge of its predecessor, allowing for smarter
design choices from the start!
